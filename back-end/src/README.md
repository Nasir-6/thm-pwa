# Back-end Architecture and Decisions

DISCLAIMER: these are based off my limited knowledge of Java, Node.js and back-end technologies in general - so if there are any better alternatives I would really appreciate any feedback. But sometimes you just have to go with what you know until you can get any sort of feedback.

## Why Node.js?

- It is lightweight compared to Java - I don't expect anyone to fund the project so decided it's best to minimise costs by reducing the memory usage of the server on a service like Digital Ocean.
- The asynchronous nature allows Node.js to handle multiple concurrent requests - I eventually am looking to develop not just for Tower Hamlets - but in the future for all of the UK.
- It's a simple API with much of it being fetching data from a database - so not much is needed in terms of the rich security/data intensive processes provided by Java
- The biggest reason is TypeScript:
  - Eliminates the main argument of Java having static typing to minimise bugs
  - I always wanted to learn it but kept putting it off.
  - Maximise productivity by using one language for both client and server
  - It would allow me to deepen my understanding of JS as well as TS by being forced to apply the more advanced/uncomfortable concepts

Note: Initially I was going to be lazy and go with Java due to the fact I was more comfortable with building an API with it and the fact I had no exprience with Node.js/Express and TS. However due to the above reasons I decided to make the leap and learn Node.js and TS.

## Why a REST API?

- I do have plans to expand into the mobile application sphere so making it a REST API would allow me to use the server/data for all future platforms

## The Architecture

It is built on a Route - > Controller -> Service -> DAO/DB architecture with dependency injection to allow for testing of all components.

### Why Dependency injection?

- I want all components/functions to be tested
- It's a service that will be used by 1000s and I would like to ensure minimal downtime by building a CI/CD pipeline which tests any changes to the code before being pushed to production

### But there are no tests written yet!

- Once the server routes/services have stablised in development I will add tests to ensure I'm not writing tests which will eventually have to be rewritten multiple times
- I'm still working my way through the intricate details of how it all works so as my understanding changes so will most of the tests
- Any future features will be developed using TDD

###Â Business Analogy for the Architecture
I've come up with an analogy for my future self in case I forget where I should place things for future development. Here it is:
This architecture has 4 main players just like in a business which will be explained below:

1. Routes -> Customers/Clients
2. Controllers -> Manager
3. Services -> Employee
4. DB/DAO -> Special Employee who has access to confidential info about the company

#### Routes -> Customers/Clients

Each Customer/Client has a specific need and requirements with a load of background information. The Routes are similar in the sense this is where a request comes in but with a load of background information (Request Headers/Body). They only want the response and don't care about anything else.
